I figure I will write a post about each of the pets in my life. This first post will focus on my most time consuming dog.

== Who? 

Duke the tripod. His nicknames are the Big Cat, the Big Pooper, the Super Pooper, the Big Dog, Boss, Dukie, and the Dukester. This lovable treeing walker coon hound melts hearts wherever he goes. He is a very handsome dog with a kind face. He doesn't act like a typical dog however. Duke is virtually oblivious to all other animals around him. A squirrel could be sitting right next to him and Duke wouldn't pay him any attention. A cat could be eating all of his kibble, Duke would let it slide.

== How?

How did Duke come into my life? Duke was a intended to be a hunting dog. However, Duke does not hunt. So they decided to make Duke a farm dog. However, Duke does not farm. So then Duke became an abandoned dog. His owners kept him outside while their other dogs got to live inside. One day a neighbor of the owners gave us a call to see if we would foster him. They were scared for his live as he would wander into the road or shiver through cold winter nights. How some people can be so cruel is beyond me!

== Thanks Chemung Valley Veterinary Clinic and Colonial Animal Hospital

A couple years ago Duke (who is terrified of thunder) got hit by a truck. Definitely not the drivers fault. He heard thunder and darted into the street. Luckily through the wonderful care of link:http://cvvetclinic.com/[Chemung Valley Veterninary Clinic] and the http://colonialvet.com/[Colonial Animal Hospital] he survived. He was a bloodied pulp of a mess with broken bones and a smashed jaw. CVVC stabilized him and Colonial Animal Hospital got him in right away. I could never say enough nice things about this places.
